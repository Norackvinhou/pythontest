# The OpenPyXL third-party module handles Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx files).
# openpyxl.load_workbook(filename) returns a Workbook object.
# get_sheet_names() and get_sheet_by_name() help get Worksheet objects.
# The square brackets in sheet[â€˜A1'] get Cell objects.
# Cell objects have a "value" member variable with the content of that cell.
# The cell() method also returns a Cell object from a sheet.
